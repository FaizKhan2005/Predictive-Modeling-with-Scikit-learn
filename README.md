# ðŸ›³ Titanic ML Project

A complete machine learning project using the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.  
This project covers **data cleaning**, **visualization** (Seaborn & Matplotlib), and a **Logistic Regression model** for prediction.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Loads Titanic dataset from a public URL
- Cleans and preprocesses missing values
- Encodes categorical variables
- Creates visualizations:
  - Survival count plot
  - Survival by gender
  - Age distribution
  - Age vs Survival (boxplot)
  - Fare vs Survival (boxplot)
  - Passenger Class vs Survival
  - Correlation heatmap
- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluates model performance with:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix (numeric & heatmap)
  - Classification report
